    "\n",
    "Here's how the model works, given an unordered list of cities and a complete weighted graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a full tour the algorithm first sorts the list in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of nodes:\n",
    "    -The first city in the list is saved as a reference\n",
    "    -All other cities are sorted in order of how far away they are from the first city\n",
    "\n",
    "After the list is sorted the list is split into even and odd indices, then the odd indices list is mirrored in order, then the odd indices list is appended to the even list again. Then afterwards the first element of the reappended list is put on the end to complete the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. for the list of nodes (A,B,C,D), assuming the list is sorted as described above with A as the start of the tour:\n",
    "    -It's split into (A,C), the even list, and (B,D), the odd list\n",
    "    -(B,D) becomes (D,B)\n",
    "    -Then the lists are reappened to make (A,C,D,B)\n",
    "    -Then A is appended on to the end to make (A,C,D,B,A)\n",
    "\n",
    "The list output by this process is assumed to be a very strong approximation of the optimal order of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the sorted touring order is obtained the model uses a greedy graph search algorithm. When constructing a route between two points the model finds the immediate best next node by seeing which middle node is the closest to the target node. The model uses this process to find the assumed shortest routes between cities in the sorted list in order (e.g. A->C, then C->D, etc.) until all adjacent nodes are connected by a route. During tour construction a record is kept of which cities have already been visited to make sure that there are no repeat locations.\n"
